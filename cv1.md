# Briefly about myself
Browsing some sites I admired how wonderful they looked like and worked and at the same time looking for some services or doing online shopping I noticed that some of the sites have awful design, work improperly. I thought that something can be improved there. I dream of making a couple of sites in future, but supposed that it's too hard. I was trying to do some schoolin learning html and css, but  some info turned out to be a little deprecated. One great person advised me to study JS as the easiest for beginners. Every day I see how fast our world and technologies develop and programming is needed everywhere. I'm dreaming taking part in projects connected with health and medicine, education and help people and be useful for the society. To my mind programming is the best way to create future.
